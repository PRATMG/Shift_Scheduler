# Employee Shift Scheduler

## **Overview**
This project is an **Employee Shift Scheduler** implemented in two programming languages: **JavaScript** (Web-based) and **Python** (Console-based). The scheduler assigns employees to shifts based on their preferences while ensuring scheduling constraints are met.

✅ No more than **one shift per day** per employee  
✅ No more than **five shifts per week** per employee  
✅ Ensures at least **two employees per shift**  
✅ Prevents assigning an employee to a shift if both preferences are full  
✅ **Web-based UI (JavaScript)** & **Console-based interaction (Python)**

- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** (Frontend Web Version)
- **Python** (Command-Line Version)
